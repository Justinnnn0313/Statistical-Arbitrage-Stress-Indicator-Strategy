# Abstract

This repository implements a statistical arbitrage pairs trading strategy based on Perry Kaufman's Stress Indicator, specifically designed for highly correlated commodity futures. The strategy employs a "triple stochastic" methodology to identify mean reversion opportunities in the relative strength relationship between two correlated assets.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Signal Generation**: Utilizes triple stochastic oscillator calculations to standardize spread extremity into a 0-100 scale
- **Risk-Balanced Position Sizing**: ATR-based equal-risk exposure methodology ensures proper hedging
- **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Dual stop-loss mechanisms including time-based and loss-based exits, plus correlation monitoring
- **Robust Backtesting Framework**: Complete simulation engine with slippage, transaction costs, and detailed trade analytics
- **Visualization Suite**: Equity curves, drawdown analysis, signal visualization, and position tracking

## Performance Highlights

Methanol-Ethylene Glycol pair, 2017-2021:
- Annual Return: 3.48%
- Cumulative Return: 12.71%
- Win Rate: 58.6%
- Max Drawdown: -23.28%
- Average Holding Period: 4 days

The strategy is particularly suited for short-term trading of highly correlated commodity pairs with correlation coefficients above 0.85.
